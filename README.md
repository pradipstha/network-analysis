# network-analysis
This repository contains network (relationship) analysis between character's of J. K. Rowling's fantasy novel. 
Rowling is a British author best known for her seven-book series-Harry Potter, which depicts a story of a young wizard named Harry Potter and his companions, who are all students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Here I am tried establishing relationships among characters from the perspective of social networks using NetworkX and Pyvis. The relationships (edges) between characters are depicted graphically in networks (nodes) based on centrality- between and closeness. I have estimated the intricate patterns of relationships provided by network analysis, and the network's basic characteristics gleaned from examination of network's structure. Analyzing complex character relationships can aid in reading a novel with too many characters because readers are frequently perplexed by complex character relationships.
